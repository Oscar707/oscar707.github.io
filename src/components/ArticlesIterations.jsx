          The purpose of this article is to share a study method that I used during my college years. This method changed how I improve in other areas of life as well.

          The "classic" way of studying for a multiple choice test was to do 50 multiple choice questions, check the answers, then review all the mistakes. This method is ineffective because for every new question, I assume that my previous thought processes / answers are correct.
